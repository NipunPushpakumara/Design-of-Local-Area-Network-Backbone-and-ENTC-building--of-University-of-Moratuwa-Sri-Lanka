# Design-of-Local-Area-Network-Backbone-and-ENTC-building--of-University-of-Moratuwa-Sri-Lanka

Task was to design the entire backbone network  and the local area network designed for ENTC building instead of the existing network.
In analizing the existing network, we researched the cabling ,node allocation ,access point locations ,Ip adress allocations,subnetting, aggregating ,distance measuring,cost,ect.According to the research We started implemanting the network on our own.Our main goal was to maximize the broadway of the network coverage with minmum cost.
